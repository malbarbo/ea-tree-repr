# Spanning tree representation for evolutionary algorithms

This project contains some implementations of spanning trees data structures
that can be used in evolutionary algorithms.

## Compiling and executing the experiments

To compile this project it is necessary to have Rust
[installed][install-rust].

To compile the project, execute:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The executables will be generated in `target/release` directory. For usage
information call each executable with the `--help` argument.

## How to cite

We are in the process of publishing a paper describing the data structures
implementations. Soon we will add a reference to the paper.
